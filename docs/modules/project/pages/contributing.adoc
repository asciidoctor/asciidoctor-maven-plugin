== Hacking

Developer setup for hacking on this project isn't very difficult.
The requirements are very small:

* Java 8 or higher
* Maven 3

Everything else will be brought in by Maven.
This is a typical Maven Java project, nothing special.
You should be able to use IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Netbeans without any issue for hacking on the project.

== Testing

Unit tests are written with http://spockframework.org/[Spock].
This will be downloaded by Maven and can be run from IntelliJ without any additional setup.
Tests are run simply by:

 ./mvnw clean test

Or any of the other goals which run tests.

Integration tests under `src/it` are run using link:https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/[maven-invoker-plugin] and the `runt-its` profile.
To only run them without excluding unit tests, use:

 ./mvnw clean verify -DskipTests -Prun-its

To run all tests at once just use `./mvnw clean verify -DskipTests -Prun-its`.
