The Asciidoctor Maven Site integration collaborates with Doxia to expose some of its information.

== Document Header metadata

The following elements from the {asciidoctor-docs-url}/document/header/[header] are integrated:

document title:: used to inform the {maven-site-plugin-docs-url}/examples/sitedescriptor.html#Breadcrumbs[breadcrumb] line when these are enabled.

author(s):: full representation (full name and email) will be present as HTML `<meta name="author" ... >` tags inside the HTML `<head>`.
In case of multiple authors, each one will appear in a distinct `meta` element.

revision date:: the header revision date value will be presented as-is in a `<meta name="date" ... >` element.
Alternatively, if not set, the generated value of `docdatetime` will be used.
