= Asciidoctor Maven User Manual

The Asciidoctor Maven Plugin is the official way to convert your {uri-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] documentation using {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] from an {uri-maven}[Apache Maven] build.

The project main goal is to offer a thin layer on top of https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[Asciidoctorj] following as much as possible to common Maven practices.

The conversion can happen in 2 flavors:

. As a xref:plugin:introduction.adoc[Maven plugin]: AsciiDoc files are converted at full Asciidoctor power independently from Maven site,

. As a xref:plugin:introduction.adoc[Maven site module]: AsciiDoc files are integrated with https://maven.apache.org/doxia/[Maven Doxia] tools, however, with a few limitations.
