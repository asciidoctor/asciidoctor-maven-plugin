The Asciidoctor Maven Plugin is the official way to convert your {uri-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] documentation using {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] from an {uri-maven}[Apache Maven] build.

The conversion can happen in 2 flavors:

. as a Maven plugin: AsciiDoc files are converted at full Asciidoctor power independently from Maven site,

. as a Maven site integration: AsciiDoc files are integrated with Maven reports, which comes with
a few limitations (see below for details).

== Maven Plugin

=== Setup

As this is a typical Maven plugin, simply declare the plugin in the `<plugins>` section of your POM file:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
.Plugin declaration in pom.xml
----
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
        <artifactId>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{release-version}</version> <!--1-->
        ...
    </plugin>
</plugins>
----
<1> As this plugin tracks the version of Asciidoctor, you can use whichever version of Asciidoctor you prefer.

[source,xml]
.Execution setup
----
<plugin>
    ...
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>output-html</id>              <!--1-->
            <phase>generate-resources</phase> <!--2-->
            <goals>
                <goal>process-asciidoc</goal> <!--3-->
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----
<1> This is simply an unique id for the execution
<2> The asciidoctor-maven-plugin does not run in any phase by default, so one must be specified
<3> The (only for the moment) Asciidoctor Maven plugin goal

=== Configuration

There are several configuration options that the Asciidoctor Maven plugin accepts, which parallel the options in Asciidoctor:

sourceDirectory:: defaults to [.path]_$\{basedir}/src/main/asciidoc_

[NOTE]
====
All paths and AsciiDoc documents that start with `pass:[_]` are considered _internal_ and are skipped.
That is, AsciiDocs are not rendered and resources are not copied to target, but you can include them normally from other AsciiDocs. +
This is useful to split your sources in sets of master documents and included parts.
====

sourceDocumentName:: an override to process a single source file; defaults to all files in `$\{sourceDirectory}`
sourceDocumentExtensions:: (named `extensions` in v1.5.3 and below) a `List<String>` of non-standard file extensions to render.
Currently ad, adoc, and asciidoc will be rendered by default
resources:: list of resource files to copy to the output directory (e.g., images, css).
The configuration follows the same patterns as the `maven-resources-plugin`.
If not set, all resources inside `$\{sourceDirectory}` are copied.
+
[NOTE]
====
Converters that embed resources such as images into the output document need to be able to locate those resources at conversion time.
For example, when generating a PDF (or HTML with the `data-uri` attribute set), all images need to be aggregated under a common root (i.e., image catalog).
The `imagesdir` attribute should be overridden to point to that folder.
When converting to HTML, images must be copied to the output location so that the browser can resolve those images when the user views the page.
====
+
[source, xml]
----
<resources>
    <resource>
        <!-- (Mandatory) Directory to copy from. Paths are relative to maven's ${baseDir} -->
        <directory>DIRECTORY</directory>
        <!-- (Optional) Directory to copy to. By default uses the option `outputDirectory` -->
        <targetPath>OUTPUT_DIR</targetPath>
        <!-- (Optional) NOTE: SVN, GIT and other version control files are excluded by default, there's no need to add them -->
        <excludes>
            <exclude>**/.txt</exclude>
        </excludes>
        <!-- (Optional) If not set, includes all files but default exceptions mentioned -->
        <includes>
            <include>**/*.jpg</include>
            <include>**/*.gif</include>
        </includes>
    </resource>
    ...
<resources>
----
outputDirectory:: relative paths are added to the project root path. Defaults to [.path]_${project.build.directory}/generated-docs_.
outputFile:: defaults to `null`, used to override the name of the generated output file, can be a relative or absolute path.
Useful for backends that create a single file, e.g. the pdf backend.
All output will be redirected to the same file, the same way as the `-o, --out-file=OUT_FILE` option from the `asciidoctor` CLI command.
baseDir:: (not Maven's basedir) enables to set the root path for resources (e.g. included files), defaults to `$\{sourceDirectory}`
skip:: set this to `true` to bypass generation, defaults to `false`
preserveDirectories:: enables to specify whether the documents should be rendered in the same folder structure as in the source directory or not, defaults to `false`.
When `true`, instead of generating all output in a single folder, output files are generated in the same structure.
See the following example
+
[source]
----
    ├── docs                          ├── docs
    │   ├── examples.adoc             │   ├── examples.html
    │   └── examples            =>    │   └── examples

    └── index.adoc                    └── index.html
----
relativeBaseDir:: only used when baseDir is not set, enables to specify that each AsciiDoc file must search for its resources in the same folder (for example, included files).
Internally, for each AsciiDoc source, sets `baseDir` to the same path as the source file.
Defaults to `false`
imagesDir:: defaults to `images`, which will be relative to the directory containing the source files
backend:: defaults to `docbook`
doctype:: defaults to `null` (which trigger's Asciidoctor's default of `article`)
eruby:: defaults to erb, the version used in JRuby
headerFooter:: defaults to `true`
templateDir:: directory of Tilt-compatible templates to be used instead of the default built-in templates, disabled by default (`null`)
templateEngine:: template engine to use for the custom converter templates, disabled by default (`null`)
templateCache:: enables the built-in cache used by the template converter when reading the source of template files.
Only relevant if the `:template_dir` option is specified, defaults to `true`
sourceHighlighter:: enables and sets the source highlighter (currently `coderay` or `highlight.js` are supported)
sourcemap:: adds file and line number information to each parsed block (`lineno` and `source_location` attributes), defaults to `false`
catalogAssets:: tells the parser to capture images and links in the reference table available via the `references` property on the document AST object (experimental), defaults to `false`
attributes:: a `Map<String,Object>` of attributes to pass to Asciidoctor, defaults to `null`
embedAssets:: Embedd the CSS file, etc into the output, defaults to `false`
gemPaths:: enables to specify the location to one or more gem installation directories (same as GEM_PATH environment var), `empty` by default
requires:: a `List<String>` to specify additional Ruby libraries not packaged in AsciidoctorJ, `empty` by default
extensions:: `List` of extensions to include during the conversion process (see link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj/blob/master/README.adoc#extension-api[AsciidoctorJ's Extension API] for information about the available options).
For each extension, the implementation class must be specified in the `className` parameter, the `blockName` is only required when configuring a _BlockProcessor_, _BlockMacroProcessor_ or _InlineMacroProcessor_.
Here follows a configuration example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    ...
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <configuration>
                ...
                <extensions>
                    <extension>
                        <className>org.asciidoctor.maven.SomePreprocessor</className>
                    </extension>
                    <extension>
                        <className>org.asciidoctor.maven.SomeBlockProcessor</className>
                        <blockName>yell</blockName>
                    </extension>
                </extensions>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>

        <dependency> <!--1-->

            <artifactId>my-asciidoctor-extensions</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
----
<1> Note that processors must be included in the plugin's execution classpath, not in the project's.

NOTE: Extensions can also be integrated through the SPI interface implementation.
This method does not require any configuration in the [.path]_pom.xml_, see link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj#extension-spi[Extension SPI] for details.

==== Built-in attributes

There are various attributes Asciidoctor recognizes.
Below is a list of them and what they do.

title:: An override for the title of the document.

NOTE: This attribute, for backwards compatibility, can still be used in the top level configuration options.

Many other attributes are possible.
Refer to the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attribute-catalog[catalog of document attributes] in the Asciidoctor user manual for a complete list.

More will be added in the future to take advantage of other options and attributes of Asciidoctor.
Any setting in the attributes section that conflicts with an explicitly named attribute configuration will be overidden by the explicitly named attribute configuration.
These settings can all be changed in the `<configuration>` section of the plugin section:

[source,xml]
.Plugin configuration options
----
<plugin>
    <configuration>
        <sourceDirectory>src/docs/asciidoc</sourceDirectory>
        <outputDirectory>target/docs/asciidoc</outputDirectory>
        <backend>html</backend>
        <doctype>book</doctype>
        <attributes>
            <stylesheet>my-theme.css</stylesheet>
        </attributes>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

==== Passing POM properties

It is possible to pass properties defined in the POM to the Asciidoctor processor.
This is handy for example to include in the generated document the POM artifact version number.

This is done by creating a custom AsciiDoc property in the `attributes` section of the `configuration`.
The AsciiDoc property value is defined in the usual Maven way: `${property.name}`.

[source,xml]
----
<attributes>
    <project-version>${project.version}</project-version>
</attributes>
----

The custom AsciiDoc property can then be used in the document like this:

 The latest version of the project is {project-version}.

==== Setting boolean values

Boolean attributes in asciidoctor, such as `sectnums`, `linkcss` or `copycss` can be set with a value of `true` and unset with a value of `false`.

==== Examples

In the `<attributes>` part of the Asciidoctor Maven Plugin configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<sectnums>true</sectnums>
<linkcss>false</linkcss>
----

You can find more information and many examples ready to copy-paste in the {uri-examples}[Asciidoctor Maven examples] project.

==== Command line configuration

Configuration options can be set (but not replaced) using system properties directly in the command line as follows:

 mvn generate-resources -Dasciidoctor.sourceDirectory=src/docs -Dasciidoctor.outputDirectory=target/docs

All options follow the naming convention _`asciidoctor.` + option_name_.

In order to provide a higher degree of flexibility `attributes` configuration follows a different behavior.
Attributes defined through the command line are added to the ones already found in the XML configuration.
The result of it is that attributes and other configuration options can be updated if they are added to the command line as attributes.
For example, the following configuration could be modified with the command options as seen below.

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    <backend>html5</backend>
    <sourceHighlighter>coderay</sourceHighlighter>
    <attributes>
        <toc>left</toc>
    </attributes>
</configuration>
----

 mvn generate-resources -Dasciidoctor.attributes=toc=right

 mvn generate-resources -Dasciidoctor.attributes="toc=right source-highlighter=highlight.js imagesdir=my_images"

Note that in the second case we need to use quotes due to the spaces, and that `source-highlighter` is the asciidoctor attribute name used to update the configuration.

=== Multiple outputs for the same file

Maven has the ability to execute a Mojo multiple times.
Instead of reinventing the wheel inside the Mojo, we'll push this off to Maven to handle the multiple executions.
An example of this setup is below:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
.Multiple configuration extract
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
    <artifactId>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{release-version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>output-html</id>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>process-asciidoc</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <sourceHighlighter>coderay</sourceHighlighter>
                <backend>html</backend>
                <attributes>
                    <toc/>
                    <linkcss>false</linkcss>
                </attributes>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>output-docbook</id>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>process-asciidoc</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <backend>docbook</backend>
                <doctype>book</doctype>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <sourceDirectory>src/main/asciidoc</sourceDirectory>
        <headerFooter>true</headerFooter>
        <imagesDir>../resources/images</imagesDir> <!--1-->
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> `imagesDir` should be relative to the source directory.
It defaults to `images` but in this example the images used in the docs are also used elsewhere in the project.

Any configuration specified outside the executions section is inherited by each execution.
This allows an easier way of defining common configuration options.

== Maven Site Integration

=== Setup

To author your Maven-generated site in AsciiDoc, you must first add a dependency on the Asciidoctor plugin to your maven-site-plugin declaration (which more precisely adds a Doxia Parser Module).

IMPORTANT: Maven v3.2.1 or above required, and since asciidoctor-maven-plugin v1.5.6 only maven-site-plugin v3.4 or above is supported.

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
.Maven site integration
-----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.4</version>
            <dependencies>
                <dependency><!-- add Asciidoctor Doxia Parser Module -->
                    <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
                    <artifactId>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>{release-version}</version>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
-----

The Asciidoctor Doxia module follows the maven-site-plugin conventions for file location, and delegates all resource management to it.

First, all of your AsciiDoc-based files should be placed in [.path]_src/site/asciidoc_ with an extension of `.adoc`.
These files will be rendered into the [.path]_target/site_ directory.
For example, the file [.path]_src/site/asciidoc/usage.adoc_ will be rendered into [.path]_target/site/usage.html_.

Then, all resources (images, css, etc.) should be placed in [.path]_src/site/resources_.
These will be automatically copied into [.path]_target/site_.

Also note that AsciiDoc files are converted to embeddable HTML and inserted into the site's page layout.
This disables certain features such as a the sidebar toc.

Make sure you add a `menu` item for each page so you can access it from the site navigation:

[source,xml]
-----
<body>
    ...
    <menu name="User guide">
        <item href="usage.html" name="Usage" />
    </menu>
    ...
</body>
-----

=== Configuration

As of version 1.5.3 of the plugin, you can configure Asciidoctor by specifying configuration properties in the plugin declaration, just like with the main plugin goal.
There are two important differences, however.

. All the configuration for Asciidoctor in the site integration must be nested inside an `<asciidoc>` element.
This is necessary since the `<configuration>` element is used to configure more than just the Asciidoctor integration.
+
Here's an example that shows how to set options, attributes and ignore partial AsciiDoc files (i.e., files that begin with an underscore).
+

----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Asciidoctor base directory (i.e., document root) is configured as [.path]_src/site/asciidoc_ by default, though this can be overridden.
To do so, you can use either maven-site-plugin `siteDirectory` or Asciidoctor `baseDir` configuration options.
Note that the first will affect the default resources directory also.
====
+
You'll notice in the example that excludes have been added for certain AsciiDoc files.
This prevents the site integration from processing partial files (i.e., includes) as individual pages.
You can tune this pattern to your liking.
There's currently no way (that we can tell) to configure this automatically.

. For simplicity and the fact that resources are managed by maven-site-plugin, not all options found in the asciidoctor-maven-plugin are available in the `<asciidoc>` element.
+
The supported ones are:

baseDir::
Sames as the plugin's `baseDir`.
Sets the root path for resources.
Not set by default, AsciiDoc documents will be searched in [.path]_src/site/asciidoc_.
External resources should be located in [.path]_src/site/resources_.
+
NOTE: Consider using maven-site-plugin's `siteDirectory` instead for better integration with the site functions (ie. resource copying).

templatesDir (also template_dir)::
Built-in template are supported by specifying a templates directory (i.e., `templatesDir`).
This feature enables you to provide a custom template for converting any node in the tree (e.g., document, section, listing, etc).
Custom templates can be extremely helpful when trying to customize the appearance of your site.

templatesDirs (also template_dirs)::
Allows to set multiple templates.
Note that each one should be enclosed in a `<dir>` element.

requires::
Sames as the plugin's `requires`.
Specifies additional Ruby libraries not packaged in AsciidoctorJ, `empty` by default.

== Hacking

Developer setup for hacking on this project isn't very difficult.
The requirements are very small:

* Java
* Maven 3

Everything else will be brought in by Maven.
This is a typical Maven Java project, nothing special.
You should be able to use IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Netbeans
without any issue for hacking on the project.

== Building

Standard Maven build:

 mvn clean install

== Testing

Unit tests are written with http://spockframework.org/[Spock].
This will be downloaded by Maven and can be run from IntelliJ without any additional setup.
Tests are run simply by:

 mvn clean test

Or any of the other goals which run tests.

Integration tests under `src/it` are run using link:https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/[maven-invoker-plugin] and the `runt-its` profile.
To only run them without excluding unit tests, use:

 mvn clean verify -DskipTests -Prun-its

To run all tests at once just use `mvn clean verify -DskipTests -Prun-its`.

== Tips & Tricks

=== Generate your documentation in separate folders per version

Use Maven `project.version` property to create dedicated custom output directories.

[source, xml]
-----
<configuration>
    ...
    <outputDirectory>target/generated-docs/${project.version}</outputDirectory>
    ...
</configuration>
-----

=== Enable section numbering

Enable section numbering in the build using the `attributes` section.

[source, xml]
-----
<configuration>
    ...
    <attributes>
        ...
        <sectnums>true</sectnums>
        ...
    </attributes>
    ...
</configuration>
-----

=== Add version and build date to the header

Automatically add version details to header and footer to all documents.

[source, xml]
-----

<properties>
   <maven.build.timestamp.format>yyyy-MM-dd HH</maven.build.timestamp.format>  <1>
</properties>

<configuration>
    ...
    <attributes>
        ...
        <revnumber>${project.version}</revnumber>
        <revdate>${maven.build.timestamp}</revdate>
        <organization>${project.organization.name}</organization>
    </attributes>
    ...
</configuration>
-----
<1> Add `maven.build.timestamp.format` to the pom's properties section to set a custom date format.
